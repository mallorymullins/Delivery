		<h1>Chapter 1: Going inside</h1>
		<p> You choose to go <i>inside</i> despite your training to never go inside someones home. Who follows those rules anyway? <b>All that matters is that tip</b>.</p>
		<p> You have been stiffed to many times today to get stiffed again. </p>
		
		<p>After you go inside you notice the lady shuts the door behind you. As you are walking to put the pizzas on the counter you notice some odd pictures hanging on the wall. What are they? They are to weird to be real, right? They can't be real... </p>
