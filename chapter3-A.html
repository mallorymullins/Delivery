		<h1>Chapter Three: Smile and Wave</h1>
		
		<p> You decide to keep your cool and smile. You ask the woman to sign the receipt and pray she doesn't stab you  instead. The woman sets down the knife that she had been washing and gladly signs the receipt. 
		</p>
		<p>The woman escorts you out. You make it to your car and lock the doors. That woman gave you the chills. You peak at the receipt to see what she tipped you. </p>
		<h2>WOW!! 15 Dollars. Good thing you were nice to her!</h2>
