		<p> You bolt to the dining room table. As you grab the money, you hear a thud hit the table. You slowly look up and see that there is a knife in the table where your hand just was. </p>

		<p> The sound of rain brings you back to your senses and you think to yourself, <i>I must go and I must go now</i>. You look around, you see the windows open but its a 6 foot drop at the very least. </p>

			<li> <a href="chapter5-B.html"> Go back to the open side door.</a></li>
