		<h1>Chapter 4: The Garden</h1>
		
		<p> You decide to make a break for the side door. You have never run as fast as you have now. You make it to the door and feel you legs move even faster. You know this isnt over till your back in your car. You suddenly hear a thud behind you. You know you shouldn't look back but you do...
		</p>

			<table border="0" >
					<tr>
						<td> 
							<p> When you glance over your shoulder you see the woman's hand pressed against the window.</p> 
							<p> Even though it's just an hand, you know it has a deeper meaning. You think to youself, <i>Thank god I went for the door</i>. </p>
			
							<p>You see a fence and decide that's your exit.</p>
							<p>You jump higher than you ever had and climb over the gate. You feel a sense of relief as you see your car.</p>
							<p>Once you make it to your car, you drive off sure to never return here again.  </p>

							<p>As you're driving back, you remebered that you didn't get a tip and that you will end with $0 in tip today.</p>
							<p> While you are glad to be alive, you are disheartened about the money. It seems you aren't cut out for delivering pizzas. Maybe Uber Eats? </p>

								The End. Ending 5/7.
