		<h1>Chapter 5: The Window</h1>
		
		<p> You jump out the window. When you land you hear a crack, but with all the adrenaline you dont feel anything. However your paced is slowed just a bit as your afraid you could damage your anckle more. You're running as fast as you can but it seems you must run all the way around the house to get to your car. As you're rounding the house, you see a basement hatch fly open. Its not more than five feet from you. You turn to run the other way but before you know it you are being pounced on. You pass out.

		<p>While you did get the $5 dollar tip, you are never heard from again. The police come searching for you a few days later. but there is nothing to be found. No car left out front, nobody living in the home. Not even furniture. You are the 5th delivery driver to disappear this month alone.  </p>
