							<p> When you glance over your shoulder you see the woman's hand pressed against the window.</p> 
							<p> Even though it's just an hand, you know it has a deeper meaning. You think to youself, <i>Thank god I went for the door</i>. </p>
			
							<p>You see a fence and decide that's your exit.</p>
							<p>You jump higher than you ever had and climb over the gate. You feel a sense of relief as you see your car.</p>
							<p>Once you make it to your car, you drive off sure to never return here again.  </p>

						
							<p>As you are driving back, you think about everything that just happened. You decide that no tip is worth losing your life over, especially not $5.</p>
							<p> You also decide that this will be your last delivery ever.  </p>
